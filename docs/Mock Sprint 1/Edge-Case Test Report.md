## Bugs Found

No Bugs were found during the required edge-case testing.

The following cases were tested on the deployed application:
    1. Invalid Login credentials were rejected and the expected error message was displayed.
    2. Direct Access to the Team Page without authentication redirected the user to the Sign In page.
    3. A missing photo did not break the team page layout.
    4. Longer team member blurbs displayed correctly without overlapping or breaking the card layout.

All tested cases behaved as expected, so there are no bugs to report from the required Task 7 tests.

**Overall Result:** PASS
